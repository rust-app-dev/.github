## Rust Application Development Interest Group

This is a holding place for future activities of the (unofficial) working group for multi-platform application development in Rust.

Currently, we host related projects, repositories, issue trackers, notes, and more under the [Robius project: the `robius-rs` organization](https://github.com/mobilerust).
